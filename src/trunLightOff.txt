there is a row * column matrix, each cell means a light.
if the value of cell is '.' means the light is off
while '0' means the light is on.

while turn on one light, the up, right, left, down of it
will change status(on -> off , off -> on)

find out if it is possible to turn off all the light.
if it is possible calculate the minimal times to
turn on/off the light.
